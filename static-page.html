        <h2>Welcome to My Coffee Corner</h2>
        <p>Coffee isn't just a drink - it's a daily ritual, a moment of peace, and sometimes the only thing standing between you and complete chaos.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Coffee Matters</h2>
        <p>From that first morning sip that brings you back to life, to the afternoon pick-me-up that saves your productivity, coffee is there for us. Whether you're team espresso, pour-over perfectionist, or instant-coffee-no-shame, we're all united in our love for the bean.</p>
        
        <div class="coffee-fact">
            <strong>Coffee Fact:</strong> The word "coffee" comes from the Arabic word "qahwah," which originally meant wine. Pretty fitting, considering how essential both can be to getting through the day.
        </div>
        
        <h2>My Coffee Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Life's too short for bad coffee, but also too busy to be precious about it. Sometimes it's a perfectly crafted pour-over, sometimes it's whatever's in the office kitchen. Both have their place.</p>
        
        <div class="coffee-fact">
            <strong>Random Thought:</strong> Coffee shops are basically the modern equivalent of ancient marketplaces - places where people gather, ideas flow, and civilization happens one cup at a time.
